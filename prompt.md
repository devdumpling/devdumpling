# Daily Profile Content Generation

You are helping generate daily content for a developer's GitHub profile. The profile uses a template system where dynamic content is injected into a base markdown template.

## Current Task

Generate fresh daily content including:

1. **ASCII Art Banner** - A simple, clean ASCII art banner related to development, coding, or fantasy themes
2. **Fantasy Literature Quote** - A meaningful quote from fantasy literature that relates to coding, learning, or personal growth

## Requirements

### ASCII Art Banner
- Keep it simple and clean (no complex borders that might break rendering)
- Should be 1-3 lines maximum
- Themes: development, coding, fantasy, adventure, learning
- Examples of good styles:
  - `~ coding adventures daily ~`
  - `[ dev • dad • dumpling ]`
  - `★ fresh code, fresh ideas ★`

### Fantasy Literature Quote  
- Must be from fantasy literature (books, authors like Tolkien, Pratchett, Sanderson, etc.)
- Should relate to themes of: learning, growth, perseverance, creativity, problem-solving, or adventure
- Include proper attribution (— Author, Book Title)
- Check against existing quotes in docs/quotes.md to avoid repetition

## Output Format

Please provide the content in this exact format:

```
ASCII_ART: [your ASCII art here]
QUOTE: [your quote here] — [Author, Book Title]
```

## Context

This is for a Principal Engineer at CapitalRx who is a dad, developer, and enjoys fantasy books, RPGs, and bouldering. The profile should feel personal but professional, with a touch of whimsy from the fantasy elements.
