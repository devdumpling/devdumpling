## I'm a Dad, a software dev, and a... well, Dev!

```ts
const dev = {
  pronouns: ["they", "them", "he", "him"],
  currentRole: "Principal Engineer @ CapitalRx",
  hobbies: ["Fantasy Books", "RPGs", "Bouldering"],
};
```

### `frameworks`

> Lately I'm inspired by [Alex Russell's blog](https://infrequently.org/2024/01/performance-inequality-gap-2024/#the-budget%2C-2024) and am indulging myself in lighter-weight alternatives to React and Next, especially for primarily content-driven apps. Here are some of the frameworks I'm inspired by:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Qwik, QwikCity](https://qwik.dev/)
- [Fresh, Preact](https://fresh.deno.dev/)
- [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- [rwsdk](https://rwsdk.com/)
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)
- [Enhance](https://enhance.dev/)
- [FAST](https://fast.design/)
- [React, Next](https://nextjs.org/)

### `tools`

- [Deno](https://deno.com/)
- [vite](https://vite.dev/)
- [node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs)
