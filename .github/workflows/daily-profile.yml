            You are helping generate daily content for a developer's GitHub profile. Generate fresh daily content including:

            1. **ASCII Art Banner** - A simple, clean ASCII art banner related to development, coding, or fantasy themes
            2. **Fantasy Literature Quote** - A meaningful quote from fantasy literature that relates to coding, learning, or personal growth

            ## Requirements

            ### ASCII Art Banner
            - Keep it simple and clean (no complex borders that might break rendering)
            - Should be 1-3 lines maximum
            - Themes: development, coding, fantasy, adventure, learning
            - Examples of good styles:
              - `~ coding adventures daily ~`
              - `[ dev â€¢ dad â€¢ dumpling ]`
              - `â˜… fresh code, fresh ideas â˜…`

            ### Fantasy Literature Quote  
            - Must be from fantasy literature (books, authors like Tolkien, Pratchett, Sanderson, etc.)
            - Should relate to themes of: learning, growth, perseverance, creativity, problem-solving, or adventure
            - Include proper attribution (â€” Author, Book Title)
            - Avoid quotes already used (check docs/quotes.md if needed)

            ## Output Format

            Please provide the content in this exact format:

            ```
            ASCII_ART: [your ASCII art here]
            QUOTE: [your quote here] â€” [Author, Book Title]
            ```
