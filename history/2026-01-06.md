### `frameworks`

> Lately I'm inspired by [Alex Russell's blog](https://infrequently.org/2024/01/performance-inequality-gap-2024/#the-budget%2C-2024) and am indulging myself in lighter-weight alternatives to React and Next.

Currently, I favor:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)

(honorable mention for [Lustre](https://hexdocs.pm/lustre/lustre.html) for Gleam projects)

And here are some of the frameworks I'm inspired by:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Qwik, QwikCity](https://qwik.dev/)
- [Fresh, Preact](https://fresh.deno.dev/)
- [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- [rwsdk](https://rwsdk.com/)
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)
- [Enhance](https://enhance.dev/)
- [FAST](https://fast.design/)
- [React, Next](https://nextjs.org/)

### `tools`

- [Deno](https://deno.com/)
- [vite](https://vite.dev/)
- [node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs)
